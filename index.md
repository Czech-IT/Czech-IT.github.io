---
## Aims
Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is a fertile field of research in linguistic studies, either by applied and empirical standpoints than from theoretical and general perspectives. 
This corpus stands for comparative and contrastive analyses exhibited among linguistic structures patterns among languages during the acquisitional path by the learner.

## Corpus
The project is based on quantitative analyses of the dataset, which is constituted by an amount of different kinds of communicative situations, in order to retain a wide range of linguistic behaviors and styles:
* [Email communications](email)
* [Text messages (SMS, Chat)](text-message)
* [Oral production](audio)
* [Auto-judgements of grammaticality](survey)

## The project
Czech-IT! is a project actively mantained by Marco Petolicchio [(p-marco)](https://github.com/p-marco) and Marcello Bolpagni.

### Methods
The corpus is organized in the form of a tabular file format (spreadsheet), in which the entries are listed in a raw modality. These are navigable in the webspace by the their communicative situation, relying for a diamesic-oriented taxonomy.

Full entries are available [here](https://github.com/Czech-IT/Czech-IT.github.io/blob/master/_data/table.csv). 

Data is automatically processed towards the usage of Python libraries, specifically oriented to language processing.

### Timeline
The project starts from July, 2017 and does not have an upper limit of time, so please check the news to stay tuned.
