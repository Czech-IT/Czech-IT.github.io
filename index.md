## Introducing Czech-IT!
Czech-IT! is an open-source and open-data linguistic corpus of native Czech learners acquiring Italian language, composed by different kinds of communicative situations, in order to reveal a wide range of phenomena.

Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is a fertile field of research in linguistic studies, either by applied and empirical standpoints or from theoretical and general perspectives. 
This corpus stands for comparative and contrastive analyses exhibited by linguistic patterns among languages during the acquisitional path.

## Corpus
The project is based on quantitative analyses of the dataset, which is constituted by an amount of different kinds of communicative situations, in order to retain a wide range of linguistic behaviors and styles.

| Subcorpus                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|
| [Text messages (SMS, Chat)](text-message)   |
| [Email communications](email)               |
| [Oral production](audio)                    |
| [Survey](survey)                            |




## The project
Czech-IT! is a project actively mantained by Marco Petolicchio [(p-marco)](https://github.com/p-marco) and Marcello Bolpagni [(bolpa)](https://github.com/bolpa).

### Methods
The corpus is organized in the form of a tabular file format (spreadsheet), in which the entries are listed in a raw modality. These are navigable in the webspace by their communicative situation, wich yields a diamesic-oriented taxonomy.

Full entries are available here:
* [The complete raw dataset](https://github.com/Czech-IT/Czech-IT.github.io/blob/master/_data/dataset.csv)
* [An annotated version of the dataset](https://github.com/Czech-IT/Czech-IT.github.io/blob/master/_data/annotations-dataset.csv)
* [A table containing the informations of the learners](https://github.com/Czech-IT/Czech-IT.github.io/blob/master/_data/learners.csv)

For the annotated version of the dataset, data is automatically processed towards the usage of Python libraries, specifically oriented to language processing, and manually marked for linguistic categories.

### Timeline
The project starts from July, 2017 and does not have a deadline, so please check the news to stay tuned.
